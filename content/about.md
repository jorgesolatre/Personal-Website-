I graduated from university in English as a foreign language, since the beginning of my career I had the opportunity to work in all possible industries in relation to English, however, I realized that none of them satisfied me, so I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new industry that would give me the balance between happiness and labor demand, as a plus I could use English as my main language. After a huge research of my preferences, I decided to became part of the TECH industry. My goal was to enter this industry as soon as possible and I noticed that in my country there was a special demand for frontend developers, for that reason I decided to follow this path. I am currently studying web development on my own and I also entered to the Computer Engineering career to reinforce my knowledge in programming and logic skills.
