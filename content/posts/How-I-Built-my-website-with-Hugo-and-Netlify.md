 I started in the world of web development, shortly after I was able to carry out my first personal projects, I immediately realized that it was time to create my personal website, from the beginning I knew that these were the characteristics I needed:
- Fast
- Responsive
- Ease of adding content
- Scalable
- Fully customizable

As I was in my first steps, I did not want to spend a lot of time developing a "perfect" website, so I decided to look for alternatives to create static websites. The first option was [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), however, this did not convince me because I had some problems with npm, here is where I discovered [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I honestly invested about two days configuring and installing Hugo on my pc, a process of which I am more than happy because I learned a lot of resources like:
- Git
- GitHub
- Powershell
- Chocolatey
- Npm/yarm

Once I finished customizing everything, it was time to make it public so I opted for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) because of its incredible facilities. Another aspect to mention is how easy is to add content with Markdown, I just enter the content, commit, push and that is it. The changes arrive in my repository on Github and Netlify takes care of making them public.

I am incredibly happy with the results obtained, especially because of the loading speed, which was something that interested me a lot. According to [Pagespeed-Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) the site offers speed of 99 on mobile devices and 100 on PC.
