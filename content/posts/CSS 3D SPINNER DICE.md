I was looking for new challenges to improve my CSS skills when I found a perfect opportunity to put my experience to the test. As you know I had made many drawings with animations for which I felt confident in this type of projects, however I discovered that I never tried animations with 3D models, taking this as motivation I spent an entire day understanding how they worked and finally I made my first 3D drawing with full CSS.

## What I learned with this project

This project reinforced my knowledge with the "transform" property, I also understood how 3D works in CSS and I discovered the "nth-child ()" selector, which I used to place the numbers on the different faces of the die.
