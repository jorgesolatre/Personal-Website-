I've always liked the procedures pages that include a step-by-step system. They make you feel accompanied and sure you're on the right track. Inspired by that feeling I made a small progress bar animated with Javascript.

## What I learned with this project
I had to transform the width style into percentage, after this process I got 100%, but I needed to divided it into 3 so I subtracted 1 from the total lenght to get 99%. Finally I could have my progress steps correctly divided:
33%-66%-99%
